# Please write a program which asks the user for two numbers. The program will then print out the sum and the
# product of the two numbers.
# The program should function as follows:
# Sample output
# Number 1: 3
# Number 2: 7
# The sum of the numbers: 10
# The product of the numbers: 21
number1 = int(input("Number 1:"))
number2 = int(input("Number 2:"))
print(f"The sum of the numbers: {number1 + number2}")
print(f"The product of the numbers: {number1 * number2}")
