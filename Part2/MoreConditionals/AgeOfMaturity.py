# Please write a program which asks the user for their age. The program should then print out a message based on
# whether the user is of age or not, using 18 as the age of maturity.
# Some examples of expected behaviour:
# Sample output
# How old are you? 12
# You are not of age!
# Sample output
# How old are you? 32
# You are of age!
