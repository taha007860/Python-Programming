# Thus far, you have probably used double quotation marks " to print out strings. In addition to the double
# quotation marks, Python also accepts single quotation marks '.
# This comes in handy if you ever want to print out the actual quotation marks themselves:
# print('"Come right back!", shouted the police officer.')
# Sample output
# "Come right back!", shouted the police officer.
# Please write a program which prints out the following:
# Sample output
# print("Hello there!")
print('print("Hello there!")')
